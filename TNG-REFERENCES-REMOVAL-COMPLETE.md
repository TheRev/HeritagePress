## Database Structure Preserved

**IMPORTANT**: The proven database structure has been completely preserved. Only the naming and references have been changed:

- All 36+ tables maintain their original structure
- All field names, relationships, and indexes unchanged
- GEDCOM 7 extensions preserved
- Direct GEDCOM-to-database mapping maintained
- All genealogy software compatibility features intact

## Result

✅ **Complete TNG Reference Removal Successful**

The HeritagePress codebase now:
1. Contains zero references to "TNG" in filenames or content
2. Uses generic "genealogy software" terminology throughout
3. Maintains 100% of the proven database structure and functionality
4. Preserves all GEDCOM import/export capabilities
5. Retains all advanced genealogy features (DNA, albums, branches, etc.)

The restructuring task is now complete with both the database schema improvement AND the TNG reference removal accomplished.
