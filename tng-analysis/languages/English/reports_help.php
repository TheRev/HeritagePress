		<a name="add"><p class="subheadbold">Adding or Editing Reports</p></a>

		<p>A TNG Report is a custom-built listing of people in your database. You decide which fields to display, which people to put in the report, and how to sort them.
		You can use the report builder interface, or you can include your own SQL query instead.</p>

		<p>To add a new Report, click on the "Add New" tab, then fill out the form. To make changes to an existing Report, use
		the <a href="#search">Search</a> tab to locate the record, then click on the Edit icon next to that line.
		When adding or editing a Report, take note of the following:</p>

		<span class="optionhead">Report Name</span>
		<p>You must give your report a name. This will appear as the title when the report is displayed.</p>

		<span class="optionhead">Description</span>
		<p>Give your report a short description. This will appear under the title when the report is displayed. It should explain briefly what the report shows using
		what criteria.</p>

		<span class="optionhead">Rank/Priority</span>
		<p>Reports will normally sort alphabetically according to name, unless you give each one a ranking or priority. Lower numbers sort first. No rank sorts before any number.</p>

		<span class="optionhead">Active</span>
		<p>Your new report will not be visible to regular site visitors until you indicate here that it is active. It's a good idea to save and test your report to make sure the
		output looks as you expected it before making active.</p>

		<span class="optionhead">Choose Fields to Display</span>
		<p>Indicate which fields to display in your report by copying them from the lefthand box to the empty box on the right. You can do this by
		dragging the field from the lefthand box to the right, or by simply double-clicking on the field name. </p>

		<p>You can remove a field from the display list on the right by double-clicking on the field name. </p>

		<p>Fields at the top of the display list are displayed at the left of the report when it is displayed. To
		change the order of the display fields, click and hold a field in the righthand box and drag it up or down within the list.</p>

		<span class="optionhead">Choose Criteria</span>
		<p>Indicate which people to include in your report by choosing criteria. People who do not match the criteria will not be included in the report. Criteria statements are
		well-formed when they include a field name and a condition. For example, "Last Name = 'Lythgoe' " or "Birth Place contains 'England' ". Multiple criteria must be joined with an AND or an
		OR statement. Precedence is indicated by using parentheses.</p>

		<p>Begin any statement by choosing a field name from the upper lefthand box and dragging it to the righthand box. You can also double-click on the field name. </p>

		<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: All date fields except Last Modified Date are treated as strings and not
		as true dates UNLESS they are labeled as 'True'. Comparing dates using text or string fields is best done by comparing date components,
		such as the year only or the day only. To isolate a date component in this manner, first select  <em>Month Only From:</em>,
		<em>Day Only From:</em> or <em>Year Only From:</em>, and then select the date field from which the component will come.</p>

		<p>When working with a true date field (like Last Modified Date), you may compare the field directly to other true dates
		or true date fields. A predefined true date you may use is the Operator 'Today'. You may also use the operator 'Convert
		to Days' when relating two true dates. For example, find all records in which the Last Modified Date is less than 30 days old,
		you could choose for your criteria:<br/><br/>

		<i>Convert to Days<br/>
		Today (true date)<br/>
		-<br/>
		Convert to Days<br/>
		Last Modified Date<br/>
		<=<br/>
		30</i></p>

		<p>After choosing a field name, next choose a comparision operator from the <em>Operators &amp; Special Values</em> box. These include "=, !=, < > <=, >=, contains, starts with, ends with". Copy
		the operator to the righthand box by dragging it there or by double-clicking on the operator name.</p>

		<p>Finally, complete the statement by selecting a field or value to compare to your original field. You may also select one of the following Special Values: <em>Current Month, Current Year</em> or
		<em>Current Day</em>. To select a constant string value, enter the string without quotes in the <em>Constant String</em> field and click the adjacent <em>>></em> button.
		To add a blank string, leave the field blank before clicking the button. To select a constant numeric value, enter the number in the <em>Constant Value</em> field and click the adjacent
		<em>>></em> button.</p>

		<p>You can remove any item from the righthand box by double-clicking on the item.
		To change the order of the items in the list, select the item and move it up or down within the list by clicking on the <em>Move Up</em> and <em>Move Down</em> buttons.</p>

		<span class="optionhead">Choose Sort Order</span>
		<p>Indicate how the matching records should be sorted by choosing one or more fields to determine a sort order.
		If the first field in the list can not determine the order of any two matching records, the next field in the list will be used, and so forth. If no sort order is indicated, matching
		records will be displayed in the order they were added to the database.
		Select fields to be in the sort order by dragging them from the lefthand box to the right, or by double-clicking on the field name.</p>

		<p>By default, all fields sort in ascending order (i.e., A-Z or 0-9). To sort a field in descending order, use the pseudo-field 'Descending (Prev)'.
		The 'Prev' in parentheses means that this designation must <i>follow</i> the field it modifies. In other words,
		if you want to sort by Last Name, choose this for your sort order:<br/><br/>

		<i>Last Name<br/>
		Descending (Prev)</i></p>

		<span class="optionhead">Miscellaneous</span>
		<p>You can remove any field from the righthand box by selecting it and then clicking the <em><< Remove</em> button, or by simply double-clicking on the field name (IE only).
		To change the order of the fields in the list, select a field and move it up or down within the list by clicking on the <em>Move Up</em> and <em>Move Down</em> buttons.</p>

		<span class="optionhead">Custom SQL Query</span>
		<p>If you know structured query language (SQL) and you're familiar with TNG's table structure, you may leave the Display, Criteria and Sort areas blank and instead enter your direct
		SQL SELECT statement in the box at the bottom of the screen.</p>

		<span class="optionhead">Save + Exit vs. Save + Stay</span>
		<p>When you're ready to save your report, click "Save + Stay" to save and stay on the same page and continue editing. Click "Save + Exit" to save and return to the Reports
		menu.</p>

		<p>To see some sample reports, please visit <a href="https://lythgoes.net/genealogy/demo.php" target="_blank">https://lythgoes.net/genealogy/demo.php</a>, choose the Administrative Demo, and browse the Reports section there.</p>
